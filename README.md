# This website/application is geared towards mothers who have postpartum depression. This begins shortly after giving birth and can last for years if not treated correctly or right away. 
# My website it to build a community where mothers are in a safe and judgement free place to express their feelings and get support from others who are experiecning the same so that no one feels alone. This allows the mothers to sign up and enter a private blog area where they are welcome to post stories, ask questions and the main thing to work on becoming a healthier and happy version of themselves.
# This application will hopefully have a calendar attached so that mothers can keep track of the progress that they make with better eating habits and workout goals. Like most moms, it is hard to figure out where to start so as a mother myself who started on her own fitness jounrye I wanted to create a beginners workout for moms that target more of the core/pelvic excersiees that isnt talked about.
# We will create a tab where mothers can look at healthier eating receipts and workouts that can be done at home as well as in the gym when they want to start doing more as they get comfortable.
