# This website is geared towards mothers who have postpartum depression. This begins shortly after giving birth and can last for years if not treated correctly or right away. 
# My website is to build a community where mothers are in a safe and judgment-free place to express their feelings and get support from others who are experiencing the same so that no one feels alone. This allows the mothers to sign up and enter a private blog area where they are welcome to post stories, ask questions, and the main thing to work on becoming a healthier and happy version of themselves.
# Mothers can use this application to keep track of their progress in developing better eating habits and achieving their workout goals, with the added convenience of a calendar feature. Like most moms, it is hard to figure out where to start so as a mother myself who started on her fitness journey I wanted to create a beginner's workout for moms that target more of the core/pelvic exercises that aren't talked about.
# We will create a tab where mothers can look at healthier eating receipts and workouts that can be done at home as well as in the gym when they want to start doing more as they get comfortable.
